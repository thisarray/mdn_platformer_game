# Setup

All you need to develop the platformer game are

- A text editor
- A graphical web browser

## Text Editor

Use your favorite text editor that can edit HTML files.
DO NOT USE a word processor.
A word processor inserts formatting that makes coding more difficult.

## Graphical Web Browser

[jsgame0.js](https://github.com/thisarray/jsgame0) uses standard HTML5 to load assets through a HTML5 boilerplate.
As a result, the page should work even if you just open the file in your browser with the "file://" protocol.
For nitpickers, we are making a graphical game so the browser needs to be a graphical one.
Something like the text-based browser [Lynx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lynx_(web_browser)) would not work.

The code relies on JavaScript so you should make sure JavaScript IS NOT DISABLED in your browser.
