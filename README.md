No Phaser, all photon torpedoes.

## Recreation of MDN platformer game using [jsgame0.js](https://github.com/thisarray/jsgame0)

You can [play the game here](https://thisarray.github.io/mdn_platformer_game/).

Mozilla Developer Network (MDN) has a [HTML5 Games Workshop](https://github.com/mozdevs/html5-games-workshop)
to create a platformer game with JavaScript and [Phaser](https://phaser.io).
This is a recreation of the platformer game using [jsgame0.js](https://github.com/thisarray/jsgame0) instead.

[**Access the HTML5 Games Workshop online here**](https://mozdevs.github.io/html5-games-workshop/).

I also wrote a version of the workshop for [jsgame0.js](https://github.com/thisarray/jsgame0).
I don't know anyone that uses [jsgame0.js](https://github.com/thisarray/jsgame0) besides myself.
I have not taught this workshop.
So following the philosophy of untested code is broken, please consider this workshop broken.
Nonetheless, this workshop gives you a better understanding of how [jsgame0.js](https://github.com/thisarray/jsgame0) works.
